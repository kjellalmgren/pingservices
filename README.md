# setting up a Raspberry Pi 3 cluster using docker swarm

In this short summer project we are going to setup a docker swarm cluster using 4 RPi-3, deploy a go program as a service and se how it run. We will also deploy a docker visualizer to be able to see each docker container running. We are going to heavy rely on many other peoples work. We are going to use hypriot 64-bit OS by the HypriotOS Team and Dieter Reuter. The visualizer from Alex Ellis and more is something we will reuse right off.
